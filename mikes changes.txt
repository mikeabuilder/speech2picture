things I've done 

Using S3...
    IN AWS web site
        Create an acount in AWS if you do not have one.
        
        In AWS console, search for "manage Access Keys" and set up a new accesskey/secret access key pair. These will be used by the speech2picture program to get write access.
        
        Is S3, create a new "bucket" for storing the pictures
            set up with no blocking permissions.
            
            Add a specific permission for downloading
                select bucket, then permissions, then add 
    
    Set up credentials in the hose device (RPi) environment variables with:
    
        In Linux, a bash script can set the environemtn variables
    

    For windows, running a .cmd file with these commnds will add the environment variables permanently
        setx AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID "access keyt goes here "
        setx AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY "secret access key goes here"
        setx AWS_DEFAULT_REGION "us-west-2"    



Changes - Created a file called s3_and_qr.py which contains a function called 

    upload_to_s3_and_generate_qr    
        input prameters are 
        file_path    The path to the file to be uploaded.
        bucket_name  the name of the S3 bucket . 
        
            buckets I've defined 
                "amzn-s3-speech2picture"     root bucket and location for users pictures to go
                "amzn-s3-speech2picture/idleDisplayFiles" storage location for idleDisplay files

        The function uses AWS keys stored in environment variables named:
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       "AWS access key"
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   "AWS secret access key"
            AWS_DEFAULT_REGION      "us-west-2"

        Function uploads the named file to the named S3 bucket, then creates a QRcode.jpg to the S3 location 
        and stores this file to the same location as the file.


        The function returns "success" if successful, or "failed"  if something went wrong.


If the file containing the function is run stand-alone, it looks for files engine in "-image.png" located in the addToIdleDisplayFIles directory and stores each
file in S3, creates a QR core with the same prefix, but ending in "-S3_URL.jpg". Both the image file and the QR code file are stored in the idleDisplayFiles folder.
