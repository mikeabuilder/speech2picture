If you set the -q options on the command line, pyspeech.py will try to store each image 
it generates in amazon's  cloud storage site called AWS S3.  For this to work, you need 
to do three things:

1. Create an AWS account.
        Googling "how to set up free AWS account" can provide a good guide. 
        The amazon "free tier" should provide ltorage for lots of images. 

2. Set up "bucket" in AWS S3 to hold the files, that is public read access permissions
    2A. Create the S3 Bucket
        - Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
        - Click Create bucket.
        - Give your bucket a globally unique name (e.g., my-public-files-12345) and choose a region.
          ** You'll evntually need the bucket name and region when you set your environment variables **
        - Leave default settings for now and click Create bucket
    2B. Configure Bucket Permissions
        - Select your newly created bucket from the list.
        - Go to the Permissions tab.
        - Under Block public access (bucket settings), click Edit.
        - Uncheck Block all public access, then type confirm and click Save changes. 
    2C. Add a bucket policy to allow the public to download files
        - On the same Permissions tab, scroll down to Bucket policy and click Edit.
        - Paste the following JSON policy, replacing YOUR-BUCKET-NAME with your actual bucket name:
            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                    "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": "*",
                    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
                    }
                ]
                }
        - Click Save changes. You'll see a warning that the bucket is now public

3. set up a key pair for that is used to access the account when writing the files




Add to the python virtual environment:
    pip install boto3             (for interacting with amazon S3)
    pip install qrcode            (to create the qr code images)
    pip install pillow            (required by qrcode)
